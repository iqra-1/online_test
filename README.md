# Online Test System

## Overview

This project is an Online Test Management System developed using FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and MySQL. It provides endpoints to manage users, tests, questions, and answers. Additionally, it includes functionalities to register users, create tests, add questions and answers, and retrieve test results.

## Project Structure

- `app/`: Contains the core application code.
  - `main.py`: FastAPI application entry point.
  - `models.py`: SQLAlchemy models.
  - `schemas.py`: Pydantic schemas for request validation.
  - `crud.py`: CRUD operations.
  - `auth.py`: Authentication and authorization functions.
  - `database.py`: Database connection and setup.
  - `admin.py`: Admin functionalities.
  - `user.py`: User-related functionalities.
  - `secret.py`: Sensitive information (e.g., JWT secret).
  - `__init__.py`: Package initialization file.
- `tests/`: Contains test cases for the application.
  - `conftest.py`: Test configuration and fixtures.
  - `test_main.py`: Tests for the main application functionalities.
  - `__init__.py`: Package initialization file.
- `docker-compose.yml`: Docker Compose configuration file for setting up the application environment.
- `docker`: Docker-related scripts and files.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies.
- `test.db`: SQLite database file for testing.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- MySQL server

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iqra-1/online_test

   cd online_test
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Configure the Database**

   Ensure you have MySQL running and create a database named `online_test_system_test`:

   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE online_test_system_test;
   ```

5. **Run Migrations**

   The database schema will be automatically created when the tests run or the application starts. However, you can manually create the tables using the following command:

   ```python
   python -c "from app.database import Base, engine; Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)"
   ```

## Running the Application

1. **Start the Application**

   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

2. **Access the Application**

   The application will be running on `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
pytest
```

## Docker Setup

To build and run the application using Docker, use the following commands:

1. **Build the Docker Image**

   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

2. **Run the Docker Container**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```
